        <p>
            In my raster project I chose to create an epic battle scene over the beautiful Grand Canyon landscape. I visited the canyon last year and have been inspired to use it in some sort of project. The birds and dragon’s were all pulled off of the internet and I assembled them into this single piece. The laser beams and fire were drawn by hand in photoshop. The most challenging part of this project was taking my selfie image and trying to match the lighting on my face to the Grand Canyon so that it looked like I was right in the scene (and not photoshopped in…)
